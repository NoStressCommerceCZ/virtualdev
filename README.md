# Project mission

Folks, every of you have been fighting with settings of your local dev stack.
With every new Magento project, usualy you need to do many repetive tasks like
installing web&mysql server and configure them. That's really annoying, isnt it?
Have you realized that you repeat yourself in history?
That's the reason why we decided to start project with code name "Virtualized development" or
in short virtualdev. That provides you complete stack with all services running without
any complex setting. You can distribute this setting across whole team so every team member runs
application on same platform which can be set really close to production environment.
You can run it on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Isn't that great! It is. That's our goal!
